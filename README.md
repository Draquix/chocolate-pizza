### Assigment Goals
  Given only four hours, and all the images, and a very hi-fidelity wireframe, we were to make the page look as close to the wireframe
  as possible in that four hours.
  
### Notes
  I did scaffold one day, and spend about 5 minutes before deciding it wasn't the right time to do this assignment so I switched to working
  on something else.  In the commit history, the second commit that came after pushing the scaffolding marks the time as if starting a timer.
  In order to be true to the four hour limit, I deducted 20 minutes from my allowed 4 hours, as that's how long it took to scaffold it.
